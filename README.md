# My Voice Notes
MyVoiceNotes is an application developed for the study of data persistence in swift, using Core Data and CloudKit. 
It consists of recording audios with information of the user's choice, some descriptive title and date of recording. This is saved locally with Core Data and in the cloud with CloudKit, allowing the user to have access to these audios on other devices, linked with the same iCloud.
